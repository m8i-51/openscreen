/**
 * Find the available gap at `startPos` in a list of regions.
 *
 * Looks at the span from `startPos` up to the start of the next region
 * (or up to `totalMs` if there is no later region) and reports its size,
 * along with whether placement at `startPos` is actually valid.
 *
 * Placement is valid as long as `startPos` does not fall inside an
 * existing region and there is some room before the next one. Landing
 * exactly on the end of an existing region is fine (adjacency is
 * allowed); landing on a region's start or strictly between its start
 * and end, or having zero space left before the next region, is not.
